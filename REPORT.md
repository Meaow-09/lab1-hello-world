# The project REPORT is where students will document key learnings, challenges, and reflections on their experience using CoPilot for software development. 

# First Impressions - Initial Take on the Project Assignment
## In this section, students will provide their initial thoughts on the project assignment, including their understanding of the requirements, any assumptions they made, points that need clarification, and their overall approach to tackling the project.
## Initial Thoughts
## Assumptions Made
## Points Needing Clarification

# Key Learnings
## Here, students will summarize the most important things they learned while working on the project. This could include computer science related concepts, technical skills, insights about using CoPilot effectively, and any new concepts or tools they encountered
## Computer Science Concepts and Technical Skills
## Insights about Using CoPilot Effectively
## New Concepts or Tools Encountered

# Report on CoPilot Prompting Experience
## Student may pull examples from the JOURNAL.md to illustrate their experience, including specific interactions that were particularly helpful or challenging.
### Types of prompts that worked well
### Types of prompts that did not work well or failed

# Limitations, Hallucinations and Failures
## In this section, students will document any instances where CoPilot provided incorrect or misleading information (hallucinations) or where it failed to provide a useful response. They will analyze why these issues occurred and how they impacted their work on the project.
## For example: Fabricated APIs, Deprecated functions, Subtle logical errors, Confident but wrong explanations, Over-engineered solutions, Under-engineered solutions, overcomplicated code, oversimplified code, etc.
## Examples of Hallucinations or Failures or Misleading Information or Confident but Wrong Explanations, or Over-engineered or Under-engineered Solutions
## Analysis of Why These Issues Occurred
## Impact on the Project

# AI Trust
## When did I trust the AI?
## When did I stop trusting it?
## What signals or situations or patterns indicated low reliability?

# What I Learned
## What did you learn about software development?
## What did you learn about using AI tools?
## When should you trust AI? When should you double-check it?

# Reflection
## Did AI make you faster? Why or why not?
## Did you feel in control of the code?
## Would you use AI the same way next time? What would you change?
