This project is going to be used to demonstrate git cloning, editing, and pushing changes to a repository on GitHub, possibly dealing with merge conflicts, and other git-related operations.

## Students of AI4SE: Instructions 
1. After cloning this repository, check your remote URL using `git remote -v` to ensure you have the correct access to the repository.
2. Configure your git username and email if you haven't already, using `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email ". Verify your configuration using `git config --global --list`.
3. Update this README file: Add your name and a brief message in the ## Students Comments section below.
4. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
5. Wait for me to tell you when to push your changes to GitHub. Once you have the go-ahead, push your changes using `git push origin main` (or the appropriate branch name if you're working on a different branch).
