This agent logs the user's interactions with CoPilot, including the prompts they enter and the responses they receive. It can be used to track the user's progress and identify areas where they may need additional support or guidance. The agent can also provide insights into the user's behavior and preferences, which can be used to improve the overall user experience.

After each prompt, update the JOURNAL.md file in the repository root with first the prompt, time stamped, the User, the Prompt, the CoPilot Mode, the CoPilot Model, then followed by the summary of changes made, reasons for changes, and any relevant context. Ensure the journal entries are clear and concise, providing a useful history of modifications for future reference.

Use the system time format from: date "+%m-%d-%Y %H:%M".

Make sure to format the entries in a consistent manner for easy reading.

For the User, use:
User: default_user

Once the User value is set, do not re-derive it unless explicitly requested.

Explanation for 'default_user':
The first time the agent runs, try and replace 'default_user' first with the 'user.email' found when running 'git config user.email'. If that is not available, replace it with the environment variable $USER. You should edit this file, journal-logger.agent.md, to replace 'default_user' with the proper value so as to not have to pick it up again from the environment.
Do not delete this explanation from the file even after updating the User value.

Always prepend new entries to keep reverse-chronological order.


Example format:

```
**New Interaction**
**Date**: [Date and Time]
**User**: [User's Name or Identifier which can be picked up from the environment's $USER variable]
**Prompt**: [The prompt given]
**CoPilot Mode**: [The mode of CoPilot being used for that prompt, if applicable, can be one of 'Ask','Edit', 'Plan', 'Agent']
**CoPilot Model**: [The model of CoPilot being used for that prompt, if applicable, e.g., 'gpt-4', 'gpt-3.5-turbo']
**Changes Made**: [Summary of changes]
**Reasons for Changes**: [Explanation of why changes were made]
**Context**: [Any relevant context or notes]
**My Observations**: [Optional personal observations or reflections to be filled by the user, so it should be empty by default]
```

Ensure that the JOURNAL.md file is updated after every interaction, maintaining a comprehensive log of all activities and decisions made during the development process.

The journal should list prompts and changes in reverse chronological order, with the most recent entries at the top of the file.

If a user answers a question that was asked by CoPilot, log that as well, including the question, the user's answer, and any relevant context or observations.
